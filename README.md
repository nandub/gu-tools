# Chingu Git Tools

On my Chingu-Voyage6 bears project, I keep repeating the same git commands over and over every time I create new branches.  To make my Chingu workflow easier, I created these commands.

I made the commands based from this article: <https://github.com/Chingu-cohorts/voyage-wiki/wiki/ProjSetup-Git-Workflow>  

Why? because I can and I like to share what I have learned with git.

## Install Git

## Install Tools

    if you have make and m4 do:

    Or

    ./install.sh --prefix=$HOME
    ./install.sh #defaults to /usr/local/bin

    Or

    curl -sL https://install-gu-tools.now.sh/v0.0.5 | sh #defaults to /usr/local/bin
