# Chingu Git Tools

On my Chingu-Voyage6 bears project, I keep repeating the same git commands over and over every time I create new branches.  To make my Chingu workflow easier, I created these commands.

I made the commands based from this article: <https://github.com/Chingu-cohorts/voyage-wiki/wiki/ProjSetup-Git-Workflow>  

Why? because I can and I like to share what I have learned with git.

## Install Git

-   Following the instructions from <https://git-scm.com/downloads>, they have for Windows, Mac and Linux.

## Install Tools

    git clone https://github.com/nandub/gu-tools.git
    cd gu-tools

    make PREFIX=$HOME install

    Or

    make install #defaults to /usr/local/bin

    Or install on location reachable from $PATH.

    branch     Name of branch to delete.
```

`gucr` command

## TODO

-   Convert these bash commands into something more portable, maybe using `nodejs` or `oclif (typescript)`.
